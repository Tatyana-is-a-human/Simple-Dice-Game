# Simple-Dice-Game
Two virtual dice are rolled. A winner is decided. Hurrah.

This is a basic one-page website with a javascript cascade that is triggered by the click of a button. The project is part of the 2022 Web Development Bootcamp on udemy.com, as taught by Angela.

Feel free to build on this code for your own projects :)
